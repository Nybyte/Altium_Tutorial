# INTRODUCTION

Altium Designer is one of most famous PCB software on market that experience makers,engineers... that they use. However there a few others one like Kicad, and EasyEDA (I recommend those 2 before using altium).

Altium Designer need a licence for being used but if you are a student one you could have a free one that you could use on your own personal projects (that´s what I do). 

Here you could find software and you can Download It.
