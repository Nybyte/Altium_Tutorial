Hello guys

This I´m going to explain and share how we could do a simulation on Altium in case we don´t have an osciloscope and we need a tool that it could represent functions.

Firstly I would like to say that is kinda "easy" simulate a cirquit in AltiumDesigner because you would have to copy your circuit from your propototipe or even you can try to invent one or whatever.

Then every simulation need to do this following steps:

1-Copy your circuit with the appropiate values
2-Propose the condition and use the right Suply Voltage or them
3-Start simulate with the appropiate conditions.

Then I would propose this cirquit for simulate.
